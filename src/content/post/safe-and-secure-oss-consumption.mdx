Open Source software is the foundation of modern software projects. Any software written today [consists of 70-90% of open source code](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/blog/blog/a-summary-of-census-ii-open-source-software-application-libraries-the-world-depends-on) in form of libraries and other components. These open source libraries often comes with security risks and introduce technical debt over time in consumer software projects. These risks include

- Vulnerability
- Malware
- Unmaintained / unpopular projects
- License

In this post, we will look at how we can use [vet](https://github.com/safedep/vet), an open source tool for vetting open source libraries before use by software consumers.

Full Disclosure: I am the creator of `vet`. You can follow the GitHub project at [https://github.com/safedep/vet](https://github.com/safedep/vet)

## TL;DR

Note: Examples in this post are created by using `vet` to scan [https://github.com/safedep/demo-client-java](https://github.com/safedep/demo-client-java) which is a Java app with intentionally older version of libraries

- Install `vet` by following [documentation on installation](https://docs.safedep.io/installation)
- If you are using `homebrew`, you can install it easily

```
brew tap safedep/tap
brew install safedep/tap/vet
```

- Scan your project source code for vulnerabilities and other risks

```
vet scan -D /path/to/source
```

The default configuration should scan your package manifest (e.g. `package-lock.json`, `gradle.lockfile`, `pom.xml`) and identify the most risky open source libraries that your software depends on. Upgrading these libraries usually reduce the risk of vulnerabilities.

Instead of scanning entire source directory, you can scan specific package manifests as well. This is useful for monorepo or to avoid noise of `vet` picking up documentation or test data related sub-modules

```
vet scan --lockfiles gradle.lockfile --lockfiles ui/package-lock.json
```

## Filters

Like most other security tools, `vet` by default uses an opinionated approach to identifying "risk" which may not be suitable for all consumers. The `filters` feature of `vet` allows consumers to identify the risky OSS libraries that they care about.

- Identify only libraries that has a critical vulnerability

```
vet scan -D /path/to/source --filter 'vulns.critical.exists(p, true)'
```

- Identify libraries that are unmaintained

```
vet scan -D /path/to/source --filter 'scorecard.scores.Maintained == 0'
```

Scorecard checks are based on [OpenSSF Scorecard Project](https://scorecard.dev/)

- Find libraries with a specific license

```
vet scan -D /path/to/source --filter 'licenses.exists(p, p == "MIT")'
```

For a full list of filtering capabilities, refer to the [documentation](https://docs.safedep.io/advanced/filtering)

## Reporting

Mitigation, fixing, response or integration with other tools requires additional information which can be obtained using various [supported reporting format](https://docs.safedep.io/reporting).

Common use-cases include

- Exporting risky libraries as CSV report

```
vet scan -D /path/to/source --filter 'vulns.critical.exists(p, true)' --report-csv report.csv
```

- Exporting risky libraries as SARIF report

```
vet scan -D /path/to/source --filter 'vulns.critical.exists(p, true)' --report-sarif report.sarif
```

## Policy as Code

The filters can be combined together into YAML document to achieve policy as code capability with `vet`. It can be used to build a guard rail in CI/CD against introducing risky OSS libraries.

[Example Policy](https://github.com/safedep/vet/blob/main/samples/filter-suites/fs-generic.yml)

```
vet scan -D /path/to/source --filter-suite policy.yml --filter-fail
```

Policy violations will trigger a non-zero exit code in `vet` with error such as

```
scan failed due to error: CEL Filter Suite analyzer raised an event to fail with: failed due to filter suite match on demo-client-java/gradle.lockfile
```

This is useful for CI integration where the build step is failed based on exit code. Refer to [policy as code documentation](https://docs.safedep.io/advanced/polic-as-code) for more details.

## Conclusion

Consuming OSS libraries require security vetting. [vet](https://github.com/safedep/vet) project goal is to make the process of OSS library vetting easy and automated while providing the necessary controls and customization for wider adoption.
