## Introducing vetpkg.dev

[vetpkg.dev](https://vetpkg.dev) is a free service that provides visibility
into the security of open source components. It is built using the [SafeDep
Cloud API](https://docs.safedep.io/cloud)
to provide an easy to use interface for developers to check the security of
their open source dependencies before using them in their projects.

## Why did we build vetpkg.dev?

As the developers of [vet](https://github.com/safedep/vet), we often felt the
need for customizing security metadata visualization for open source
components. We wanted to mash up public and private data sources to provide
easy access to aggregated security data. We expect that this information will
help developers and security engineers make better decisions about the open
source components before using them in their projects.

Using `vetpkg.dev`, we want to provide a simple and easy-to-use interface for
having a single source of truth for open source component security information
including [malicious code
analysis](https://docs.safedep.io/cloud/malware-analysis) results.

## How to use vetpkg.dev?

Using `vetpkg.dev` is simple. You can search for an open source component by
its ecosystem, name and version. For example, navigate to the following URL

- https://vetpkg.dev/v/npm/express/4.17.1

You can also search for specific component by navigating to [vetpkg.dev](https://vetpkg.dev)

## How does vetpkg.dev work?

`vetpkg.dev` uses the SafeDep Cloud API to fetch security information about open
source components. This includes information about known vulnerabilities, licenses,
project metadata, malicious code analysis results and more. It uses [SafeDep
Insights API](https://docs.safedep.io/guides/insights-api-using-typescript) to
fetch the required information.
