Let's say you are building an Express.js application. You need a cookie parser middleware. But instead
of installing the original [cookie-parser](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cookie-parser) package, you install
[express-cookie-parser](/malicious-npm-package-express-cookie-parser) which is a malicious package, although
removed from the npm registry. We developers want to get the job done while in the flow state. We hate going
outside our terminals and IDEs to check if a package we are installing is malicious or not. This behavior is
exploited by malicious actors to compromise developers through [typosquatting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typosquatting)
and other supply chain attacks. To protect the software supply chain, we need to protect developers from malicious
packages at the time of installation. This is where Package Manager Guard (PMG) comes in.

## What is PMG?

[PMG](https://github.com/safedep/pmg) is a tool to protect developers from malicious packages at the time of installation. It is a CLI tool that
wraps popular package managers like `npm`, `pnpm`, etc. It prevents installation of malicious packages by scanning
the package at the time of installation.

## How do I use PMG?

The easiest way to install PMG is using `homebrew`. For other installation options, please refer to the 
[PMG GitHub repository](https://github.com/safedep/pmg).

```shell
brew install safedep/tap/pmg
```

The goal of PMG is to be as hidden and *out of the way* as possible while protecting developers from installing
malicious packages. For a seamless experience, add PMG as an alias for your package manager.

```shell
alias npm="pmg npm"
alias pnpm="pmg pnpm"
```

That's it! PMG will now protect you from installing malicious packages.
