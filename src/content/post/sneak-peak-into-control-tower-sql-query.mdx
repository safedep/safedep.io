Software Bill of Material (SBOM) provides an inventory of all software components. However, they are useful only when a flexible query interface is built on top. In this post, we provide a `#build-in-public` preview of what we are building at SafeDep. We believe a flexible query interface on top of BOM solves important use-cases for OSS risk management and software supply chain security.
