SBOM is being mandated in certain regulated industries, especially for tracking open source dependencies. However the usefulness of SBOM, which is basically an inventory, is the tooling and use-cases around it. Conventional SCA tools are notorious for false positives and noise. Ability to prevent insecure or risky open source components proactively is required to maintain a healthy and trustworthy open source software supply chain. In this talk, we look at how to use [vet](https://github.com/safedep/vet) for establishing security guardrails against risky OSS components. We also look at a case study of how a security team leverage `vet's` policy as code feature for enforcing opinionated security policies.
