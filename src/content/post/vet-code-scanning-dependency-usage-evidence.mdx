A 3rd party dependency may be referenced in a package manifest such as
`requirements.txt` or `package-lock.json` but not actually used in code.
Vulnerabilities or other risks in such packages are not useful. Most SCA tools
today lack the code context information preventing them from distinguishing
between dependencies that are actually used in the codebase and those that are
not. SafeDep Code Analysis framework augments [vet](https://github.com/safedep/vet), our free and open source tool with code
context. This allows us to eliminate false positives and noise by considering
the actual usage of a dependency in the codebase. In this article, we will look
at how we can use dependency usage evidence to eliminate noise in SCA.

## Getting Started

Ensure you have [vet](https://github.com/safedep/vet) `1.9.2+` installed in
your system. For help with installation, refer to the [vet Installation Guide](https://docs.safedep.io/quickstart).

### Create Code Analysis Database

Analyse your code base to create a code analysis database:

```bash
vet code scan --app /path/to/code --db /tmp/code.db
```

### Run `vet` Scan with Code Analysis Database

Run `vet` scan with code analysis database to augment `vet` results with
code context information:

```bash
vet scan -D /path/to/repository --code /tmp/code.db
```
